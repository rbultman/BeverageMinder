BeverageMinder
==============

The BeverageMinder is a device that works with GreenBean 
(https://firstbuild.com/mylescaley/greenbean-maker-module/) and ChillHub 
(https://firstbuild.com/bpwagner/chillhub/) to 
rapidly cool a beverage inside of your refrigerator.  It uses a fan to blow
the cold refrigerator air across your beverage in order to cool it faster
via convection.  A temperature sensor monitors the bevergage container so
you know how cold your beverage is.
